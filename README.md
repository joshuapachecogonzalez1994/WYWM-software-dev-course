# WYWM-software-dev-course

This repository was created with the purpose of being a tool to use and document my journey through the WithYouWithMe Software Developer professional certification.

WithYouWithMe is an organisation built by military veterans for military veterans and their families to help them learn the digital skills needed to move on to a career in the fields of Information Technology (IT) after leaving the armed forces of their country (their professional programs are currently recognised by both the Australian and Canadian National Defence Departments/Ministries and enable the learners to pursue careers as contractors through WYWM or partners in their chosen field).
